			   <p> <font color="white"> Information systems is one of the most crucial concepts a business student can learn
			   in college because it enables students to understand the tools organizations use to achieve their desired goals.
			   One of the key tools that categorizes an information system is the software used by people within an
			   organization to make informed, data-driven decisions. Many businesses use a variety of software applications
			   to create key documents containing information but are confined to a company's server. The usage of a company's
			   server also comes with a variety of issues such as limited access to information outside a company's network, ongoing maintenance costs, and the 
			   fear of losing information from unexpected crashes.</p>
			   <p> Thankfully, technology advancements of the <!--font color tag example #1--> <font color="red"> "Cloud" </font> within the past decade have made
			   it easier for employees to access information outside a company's network of servers so long as they have a stable internet connection to the Cloud. Likewise,
			   the rising costs for hiring and training personnel to maintain in-house servers are cut since servers are provided by cloud service vendors at a fraction of the cost. 
			   The phenomenon of losing information accidentally or due to something beyond one's own
			   control is dreaded by many people in the business world. Fortunately, the Cloud can backup information lost through a 
			   computer while also enabling users to access the same information through other devices. </font> </p>

			 <h2> <em> <u> <font color="white"> My Views About Article #1- </font> </u> </em> </h2>
			    <p> <font color="white"> As someone who has witnessed faulty servers on numerous occasions, I can attest
				that the cloud has an unbelievable number of advantges as a student as a future business professional. In college, many students often must access different applications
				for assingments; however, the life of a college student is hectic and many students, unfortunately, only get online with the little free time they are given.
				During that time, the influx of students attempting to access software at once can produce increased response times (or cause crashes) that can be detrimental when students are
				attempting to submit assignments. Thankfully, a situation like this can be prevented by having cloud service vendors add servers during peak hours when many students
				are getting online. Once the peak hours have passed, the cloud service vendors can then release the idle servers or reallocate them for an entirely different organization.
				As a future business professional, I foresee many businesses transitioning to cloud computing rather than private servers due to the costs businesses will save not having 
				to provide maintenance for servers or having to install rountine updates.</p>
				<p> Within the BAIS major, I know I will constantly have to work with and save projects across many unique applications. The prospect of using the Cloud to help organize and secure projects
				for other classes is exciting considering how powerful the Cloud truly is for storage capacity. Because the Cloud is rapidly evolving, I envision myself
				having to learn the different cloud service providers to choose from so I may become a bigger asset when discussing alternatives for in-house servers with co-workers. 
				While there are business professionals who are not welcoming of these changes, using the Cloud is a pivotal part of adapting to the rapid changes in technology. </font> </p>

				<p> <font color="white"> In management information systems, collaboration is vital to ensure businesses achieve their strategies. Team members 
				must be frequently meeting to manage projects, provide constructive feedback, and satisfy a host of other requirements critical
				to success. Nevertheless, associates living in different time zones typically do not have the time to communicate. While there are ways for members to meet virtually, 
				the landscape of technology is rapidly expanding and soon contemporary methods for meeting virtually may become oboslete within the next decade. </p>
				<p> Soon enough, mixed reality will become mainstream in the business world as a tool to collaborate from anywhere outside the traditional work environment.
				For example, <em> Microsoft </em> recently unveiled its next technological feat called <!--font color tag example #2--> <font color="orange"> HoloLens </font> in 2015 which
				is a mixed reality headset enabling users to project virtual objects onto real-world environments. With built-in cameras, a user can also video chat with others 
				on different devices and permit them to see what is in front of the user by authorizing access to the camera in HoloLens. The significance behind this is that it will empower team members to seamlessly 
				collaborate instructions to others within the company from anywhere in the world. Additionally, by projecting 3-D images of the user's work onto objects in front of them,
				users can work within their own time and be more productive than having to work in a setting outside their home. </font> </p>

			 <h2> <em> <u> <font color="white"> My Views About Article #2- </font> </u> </em> </h2> 
				<p> <font color="white"> When I first saw HoloLens in a video I was immediately blown away at what I saw. Virtual reality had already started to become popular,
				but it was not designated for business professionals as a convenient tool for collaborating. By the time I graduate, I expect mixed reality
				headsets to be widespread across many different industries to help team members achieve their goals at a faster rate that most collaboration
				tools can dream of achieving. As exciting as it is for my career, it is also quite unsettling since jobs will become more competitive with this technology.</p>
				<p> People in different countries sharing the same degree will be competing against me for the same jobs since they will have the 
				opportunity to work from home using a mixed reality headset. If this were to occur it would be unfortunate; ultimately, it is something I must be 
				willing to accept as technological development does not stop for anyone. </font> </p>
